I enjoy teaching and building practical, reusable tooling around data analysis.

At FNSPE CTU, I currently act as course responsible/lecturer for:

- **Physics of collisions of nuclei** (Master’s level)
- **Tools for simulation and data analysis** (Bachelor’s level)

I also supervise a Bachelor’s student.

This page is intentionally lightweight for now; I plan to expand it with syllabi, notes, and selected assignments.
