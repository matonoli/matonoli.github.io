# Ing. Oliver Matonoha, PhD.

I'm a Prague native and an experimental particle physicist. I did my PhD (and later my first postdoc) at Lund University in Sweden, where I lived for nearly 6 years, and since May 2024 I have been based back in Prague as a postdoctoral researcher at the Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU).

I study high-energy nuclear and particle collisions and what they can teach us about QCD matter. I work primarily within the STAR experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York (USA), and I also remain active in the ALICE collaboration at CERN in Geneva. My current interests include small systems, long-range correlations, event-structure observables, and unfolding through deep-learning methods.

I enjoy teaching and science communication. At CTU, I’m a lecturer for two courses and I supervise bachelor student projects. I also like projects that make research and education more accessible and reproducible.

Outside of work, you'll usually find me immersed in electronic music, skiing, writing poetry, or reading about interior design. I also nurture a small forest of 30+ plants and like trying new recipes to share with friends.
