# Ing. Oliver Matonoha, PhD.

I'm a Prague native who traded the city's crowded cobblestone streets for the serene landscapes of Sweden, where I pursued and earned my PhD in Particle Physics. My scientific adventures also take me to the vibrant city of Geneva, where, amidst the beauty of the Alps, I work with CERN to gather data for my research from colliding particles—almost at the speed of light! My main scientific interest involves studying what exactly do the insides of protons behave like and I investigate this by looking at (around a billion of) their collisions.

Beyond the realms of physics, I'm captivated by the boundless potential of deep learning and its innovative applications, both in my scientific endeavors and the not-for-profit sector. I find joy in communicating science, whether it's through my university teaching or other educational projects. Recently, I've also been greatly intrigued by various projects related to democratisation of knowledge and science.

Outside of my professional life, you'll find me in my element: immersing myself in the beats of electronic music, carving through snow on skis, penning down poetry, making my home cosy through Japandi interior design, nurturing a thriving collection of 30+ plants, and exploring new recipes to share with friends.

At heart, I'm a physicist driven by an insatiable curiosity, craving to learn and understand, motivated to leave my dent in the world to make it a better place.
