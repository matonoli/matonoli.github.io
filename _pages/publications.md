description: <p>I am currently employed at the Lund University as a postdoctoral researcher, having defended my PhD thesis in June 2023. My scientific objective is to experimentally study Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the non-perturbative regime – or in other words – describe how the insides of hadronic particles such as protons behave, especially in dense and hot environments. To do this, I work with the ALICE experiment, a particle detector at the accelerator LHC in CERN.</p><p>An example of such extreme environment is the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) – a state of matter that could be explained as melted and dissolved protons and neutrons into a liquid of its elementary constituents. The QGP formed the Universe microseconds after its creation, comprises the core of neutron stars, and, furthermore, can be recreated nowadays with particle colliders. </p><p>Specifically, my research focuses on developing and using new observables such as transverse spherocity and underlying event activity. My aim has been to pin down the origin of QGP-like behaviours in particle collisions – such as the enhanced production of strange quarks or collective flow – and understand their emergence. These observables are particularly powerful to isolate the effect of having multiple partonic interactions within a single hadron-hadron collision, as well as high-momentum, wide-angle radiation. Moreover, I have also been greatly interested in the role of charm and beauty quarks in the QGP, especially the behaviour of tightly-bound quarkonium states.</p>
