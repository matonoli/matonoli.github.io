  <p>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at FNSPE CTU in Prague (Global Postdoctoral Fellowship Program). I earned my PhD in Particle Physics at Lund University (June 2023) in Sweden, and I also spent my first postdoctoral period there.</p>
  <p>My scientific objective is to experimentally study Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the non-perturbative regime – or in other words – describe how the insides of hadronic particles such as protons behave (which we don't know at all, yet they make up everything around us!). One arena to study these partons and their interactions is the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) – a state of matter that could be explained as melted and dissolved protons and neutrons into a liquid of its elementary constituents. The QGP formed the Universe microseconds after its creation, comprises the core of neutron stars, and can be recreated nowadays with particle colliders.</p>
  <p>Experimentally, I remain active in the ALICE collaboration at CERN, and I currently work mostly within the STAR experiment. My research continues to focus on "small systems" and novel observables, and more recently also on long-range correlations and unfolding methods based on deep learning techniques. I aim to pin down the origin of QGP-like behaviours in particle collisions – such as the enhanced production of strange quarks or collective flow – and understand their emergence.</p>
