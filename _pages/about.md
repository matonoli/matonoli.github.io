hi, i'm a particle physicist based in Prague.  
\> i did my PhD (and my first postdoc) at Lund University in Sweden.  
\> since May 2024, i have been a postdoc at FNSPE CTU.  
\> i work mostly on the [STAR](https://www.star.bnl.gov/) experiment, continuing my research on QCD and physics of heavy ion collisions.  
\> i contribute to the [ALICE](https://alice.cern) experiment at [CERN](https://home.cern).  
\> i care about robust data analysis, statistics, and transparent scientific workflows implementing industry-advanced innovations.  
\> outside of research, i teach and mentor, and i volunteer with [Discover](https://discover.sk/en/), an educational project for youth.
